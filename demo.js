    title: 'Draining the Great Black Swamp',
    body: '<br>With the invention of the Buckeye Traction Ditcher, settlers drained the Great Black Swamp, which was 2x larger than the Everglades. The Great Black Swamp stretched westward from the Lake Erie into eastern Indiana. This period also marked the start of Ohioans dumping human, agricultural, and industrial waste into the lake. Unbeknownst to the settlers, the swamp filtered the lake’s water acting as Lake Erie’s kidney. Draining this wetland has left Lake Erie susceptible to Harmful Algal Blooms.',

    body: '<br> In the summer of 1933, western Lake Erie "looked as if it were coated with green paint" - Dr. Clarence Taft of Ohio State University. Ohioans began complaining about the foul smell. By the 1940\'s and 50\'s, many beaches were closed as health hazards. Due to waste disposal in Lake Erie by cities like Toledo and Clevland, the Lake\'s shore wateres were becoming the functional equivalent of a septic tank.',

    title: 'Scientific Signs of Trouble',
    body: '<br> In the summer of 1953, scientists began to realize that the trophic state of the Lake was shifting. Dr. Alfred M. Beeton found a 2,600 square mile area at the bottom of the Lake that had no oxygen at all. However, no progress was made to stop the pollution driving these changes because most people at that time thought the Lakes were too big to pollute and anything put into the Lakes would be sufficiently diluted. <br><br> Less oxygen dissolved in the water is often referred to as a “dead zone” because most aquatic life either dies, or if they are mobile like fish, they can leave the area. The red zones are dead zones.',

    body: '<br> Since the late 1960s (High, 2003), the Great Lakes region has experienced a steady decline in industry and population. Many cities are now struggling with shrinking tax bases and increasing demands on infrastructure investment as systems age and become outdated. Climate change has only amplified these infrastructure challenges by increasing the amount of precipitation falling in the heaviest storms in the region by 37% since the 1950’s (United States Global Change Research Program, 2014).',

    title: 'Lake Erie Declared Dead',
    body: '<br> Reporters dramatically declared Lake Erie’s death in the 1960s because the lake experienced cultural eutrophication. Eutrophication occurs when excessive richness of nutrients in a lake causes a dense growth of plant life, typically algae, and death of animal life from lack of oxygen. Cultural eutrophication refers to the same process sped up by human activity, which could include dumping excess nutrients from sewage, detergents, fertilizers, etc. into the lake. The algae from eutrophication can turn a once clear lake into what looks like a lake full of green paint, which is what happened to Lake Erie in the 1960s as schools of suffocated fish full of toxic pollutants washed ashore.',

Rhodes, used this petition to push the federal government to take action. This resulted in multiple studies, one by the IJC. <br><br> As a result of a single citizen\'s petition, the U.S. Public Health Setvice held HEATED hearings on the problems of Lake Erie in 1965. States pointed fingers at each other, while industries and cities pushed back against pending regulation with the sponsorship of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ',

    body: '<br> Federal officials of the new Federal Water Pollution Control Administration began a round of "enforcement confrences" in the Great Lakes region to promote upgrades to waste treatment requirements. This marks the shift from the "reasonable use" doctrine that gave dischargers a legitimate right to use a body of water for waste disposal, as long as its primary uses were protected. The goal of the officials was to encourage maximum feasible waste treatment. At the Lake Erie conference, David Blaushild described his community\'s impatience with the regulatory system. ',

In 1971, Walt Kelly rephrased Commodore Perry\'s (who earned the title "Hero of Lake Erie" for leading American forces in a decisive naval victory at the Battle of Lake Erie during the War of 1812) iconic line "We have met the enemy and he is ours." to "We have met the enemy and he is us." to comment on the state of Lake Erie for his Earth Day piece.

That alone made a huge difference to Lake Erie. Unfortunately, the legislators failed to address the detergent industry or agriculture directly.',

The grocery store shelves were wiped clean of bottled water almost instantly. People waited in long lines behind trucks full of water brought in by the National Guard. How did this happen?

Although a majority of voters approved the initiative, it was overturned in the courts. On February 27, 2020, U.S. District Court Judge Jack Zouhary ruled that LEBOR was invalid in its entirety because it was “unconstitutionally vague and exceeds the power of municipal government in Ohio.” Toledoans for Safe Water, who advocated for the initiative, said in response to the ruling, "In an unfortunate but predictable decision, he invalidated the democratically enacted Lake Erie Bill of Rights. This local charter amendment was the first of its kind in the United States."',
